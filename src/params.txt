; set dictionary type [gabor, gammatone, frames, onsets]
; for onsets and frames you need to specify the folder containing the samples (only mono files 16 bit)
; for onsets you need to specify also the threshold (0-1) and the timegate (sec.) for the segmentation

; these parameters are used by all the dictionary types
; J is the lowest frequency supported (1. / 2^J), suggested 10-12
SR 				44100
J 				12

; these are the threshold (0-1) and timegate (sec.) parameters for the the segmetnation of the target
; (used only if dictionary is 'onsets' or 'files')
segmentation    .01 .1

; these parameters are used only for gabor and gammatone dictionaries
; minj is the smallest timescale supported (2^minj samples), suggested 8-10
; for musical signals use oct_divisions 48-60, otherwise 1-12
; freq_limit is used to determine the highest frequency
; do not change phi_slices
minj 			10
oct_divisions 	60
phi_slices		1
freq_limit 		17000

; use 40-120 components for dictionaries 'gabor' and 'gammatone'
; use 1-6 components for other dictionaries
; use 4-8 overlap factor (only used for 'gabor' and 'gammatone')
