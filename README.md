# [Ma.p.l.e]

*Maple* (matching pursuit linear expansion) is an experimental framework for sound processing based on time/frequency decomposition and dictionary learning.

An interesting effect that Maple can do is sound hybridisation. Here you are some examples:

- [Original sound (Vox)](samples/Vox_full.wav)
- [Vox and clarinet](generation/Vox_clarinet.wav)
- [Vox and door noises](generation/Vox_doors.wav)
- [Vox and kitchen noises (onsets)](generation/Vox_kitchen_onsets.wav)
- [Vox and orchestra (onsets)](generation/Vox_orchestra_onsets.wav)
- [Vox and various instruments (onsets)](generation/Vox_various_instr_onsets.wav)


To compile, from root folder type:

`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make`
